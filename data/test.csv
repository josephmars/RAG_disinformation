why cant western weapons save day for ukraines counteroffensive the first days of the welladvertised ukrainian counteroffensive have borne no tangible results prompting disappointment among western military analysts whats behind the failure t t t russias special operation in ukraine us ukraine kiev russia antony blinken nato russian ministry of defense leopardi would say that the counteroffensive is less than what [the west expect[s michael maloof former senior security policy analyst in the us office of the secretary of defense told sputnik the extent to which the ukrainians are undertaking any socalled counteroffensive is more of a probing action than an actual assault and onslaught per maloof the failure could be largely attributed to poor planning lack of manpower resources and training western wonderweapons bite the dustthe ukrainian military has so far failed in all directions of their counteroffensive despite receiving billions of dollars worth of military equipment from the us and its nato allies in the first week alone the kiev regime forces lost thousands of casualties along with more than a dozen of german leopardtanks nearly two dozen of usmade bradley infantry fighting vehicles ifvs and several french amx rc light tanks the pictures of destroyed western military equipment have already been circulated by the media and social networks the russian armed forced has destroyed a vast amount of ukraines military equipment since day one of the special military operation including airplanes and helicopters  unmanned aerial vehicles air defence missile systems  tanks and other armoured combat vehicles  combat vehicles equipped with mrls  field artillery cannons and mortars as well as units of special military equipment according to the russian ministry of defense matviychuk has drawn attention to the fact that the russian military has repeatedly participated in local conflicts and peace missions starting from therefore despite all the shortcomings of the collapse of the soviet union the russian military equipment has undergone development and is up to date in terms of modern warfare challenges he placed special emphasis on maneuverability flaws of western armored vehicles per him the eastern european military theater with its freeze river floods mud swamps and other critical weather conditions became a serious challenge for the nato military equipment the ukrainian military has faced a plethora of logistic problems including that the german ton battle tanks could not cross some of ukraines bridges europe and the world have suddenly realized that westernstyle equipment is not second to none in many respects that it has its own shortcomings along with its advantages according to the military analyst how could kievs failures affect weapons supplies russias relatively rapid obliteration of western weapons and lack of any tangible victories on the front could affect weapons supplies according to sputniks interlocutors kiev politicians have already urged their western patrons to provide even more military equipment and armored vehicles to replace those destroyed every leopardis literally as good as gold for the decisive offensive ukrainian deputy foreign minister andrii melnyk told the german press on sunday however german defense minister boris pistorius announced earlier this week that berlin cannot replace every leopard tank destroyed on the ukrainian battlefield he asserted to kiev that germany will continue to supply repaired leoparda tanks starting from july and by the end of the year there will be more than a hundred of them [in ukraines service the minister said however according to international military observers it would be too little too late the biden administration has disbursed anothermillion to provide the kiev regime with additional m bradley infantry fighting vehicles ifvs to replace those lost over the past week as well as ammo for himars and nasams the collective west is going to maximize its support for the ukrainian counteroffensive and provide kiev with longterm aid as us secretary of state antony blinken has promised still according to maloof this enthusiasm will be shortlived whos to blame for counteroffensive failure while assessing the ukraine armys failures western analysts suggested that it stems from the lack of training in general the western observers tend to pin the whole blame on ukrainian soldiers unfamiliar with the nato equipment its not fair as per matviychuk in fact the western military industrial complex has been given a black eye rheinmetall ag a german automotive and arms manufacturer has already lostof the value of the shares due to the fact that the leopards got rapidly destroyed noted matviychuk this is reputational damage to the us defense contractors too he continued the us armored vehicles proved quite efficient in the fight against shepherds in afghanistan and iraq but in eastern europe they failed en masse which indicates the low quality of equipment in the first place per the military expert westerners started protestingit appears that the western public has grown weary of the russoukrainian conflict as well as of nato member states spending billions on weapons for kiev at the expense of their domestic economies and social programs matviychuk appears to share maloofs stance in poland there are rallies against the presence of ukrainians and the supply of weapons in bulgaria there are thousands of rallies and germany was generally divided along the axis of the former gdr and the former frg … even in the united states some congressmen say that it is necessary to urgently stop the supply of weapons [to kiev i think that as the conflict develops and aggravates the majority of socially prominent citizens will advocate for an end to the war as they are aware of the detriment first of all for their countries  ,1

accused ukraine of attempting an overnight drone attack on the kremlin with the aim of killing president vladimir putin the most dramatic charge moscow has levelled against kyiv since thewar on its neighbour began the allegation was made on wednesday by the russian government and reported by several state news agencies putin was not in the building at the time and there was no material damage to the kremlin russian officials said as they warned of their right to retaliate “the kremlin has assessed these actions as a planned terrorist act and an assassination attempt on the president on the eve of victory day the mayparade ” state news outlet ria reported adding that putin had not changed his schedule and was working at his novoogaryovo residence outside moscow moscow has vowed the parade will go ahead amid calls for a tough reaction against ukraine expresident dmitry medvedev called for the “elimination” of zelenskyy “we will demand the use of weapons capable of stopping and destroying the kyiv terrorist regime said Vyacheslav Volodin the speaker of the russian duma and putin ally the investigative committee of russia which probes major crimes said in a statement it had opened a “criminal case on terrorism ” ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy denied the accusations saying his country had not attacked moscow or its president “we don’t attack putin or moscow we fight on our territory ” zelenskyy told a news conference in helsinki finland “we defend our villages and cities ” senior ukrainian presidential official mykhailo podolyak also told the reuters news agency that kyiv had nothing to do with the alleged incident in a tweet he suggested russia’s claims were a false flag saying “russia is clearly preparing a largescale terrorist attack ” as for the drones over the kremlin it’s all predictable… russia is clearly preparing a largescale terrorist attack thats why it first detains a large allegedly subversive group in crimea and then it demonstrates

officer in the soviet academy of sciences told al jazeera that if the kremlin’s accusations were true it would be difficult to “say which kind of drones were used” “at nighttime putin doesn’t appear to be in the kremlin he goes there for working hours and doesn’t live there ” he added felgenhauer said that in retaliation it was possible that russia could order its forces in ukraine to attack the presidential offices in central kyiv volodin called for “destroying the kyiv regime” adding “no negotiations can take place with the regime of zelenskyy” video appears to show attempted attack anton gerashchenko adviser to the ukrainian minister of internal affairs said russian partisans were likely to have been behind the alleged attack “information appeared that the drone on the kremlin was launched by russian partisans from moscow region ” he wrote on twitter the kremlin did not present any evidence from the reported incident and its statements included few details an unverified video circulating on russian social media showed pale smoke rising behind the main kremlin palace in the walled citadel after the purported incident the video was posted in the early hours of wednesday on a

ukraine the soviet union used similar language — like calling prowestern ukrainians banderites — to discredit ukrainian nationalism as nazism explains jose casanova a professor emeritus of sociology at georgetown university and senior fellow at the berkley center for religion peace and world affairs and now we see [russia is doing it every time the ukrainians try to establish a democratic society they try to say that those are nazis he says you need to dehumanize the other before you are going to murder them and this is whats happening now Olga Lautman a senior fellow at the center for european policy analysis and cohost of the kremlin file podcast says russia amped up the nazi narrative after seizing crimea from ukraine in ukraine invasion — explainedhow an actorturnedpresident found himself leading ukraine during war ukraine is home to ultranationalist movements including most prominently the azov battalion which formed inand later joined the countrys national guard after fighting against russianbacked forces in eastern ukraine but lautman estimates nationalists make up aboutof ukraines population with the vast majority having very little interest in anything to do with them she said the u s probably has a higher percentage of white supremacist and nazi groups while casanova also says ukraine has a smaller contingency of rightwing groups than other western countries they also note that ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy is jewish as is the former prime minister volodymyr groysman zelenskyy was elected inwith a whoppingof the vote — a considerably larger share than his predecessors — and won a majority in every region including the most traditional and conservative according to casanova ukraine invasion — explainedif russias invasion of ukraine

during the war than any other country without counting europesmillion jewish victims as a nation he calls putins tactics simply a mythical use of history to justify presentday crimes ukraine invasion — explainedafter russias invasion of ukraine jerusalems putin pub is now just named pub its true that many ukrainian nationalists initially welcomed thegerman invaders as liberatorsduring wwii and collaborated with the occupation a fact that ukraines small farright movement is quick to emphasize putins claims seize on that kernel of truth but distort it — a classic sovietpropaganda tactic lautman who is ukrainian and russian says russia considers wwii its biggest victory and places a big emphasis on its defeat of the nazis celebrating wwii soviet holidays many times a year russian television channels played wwii movies on the day of putins announcement about invading ukraine lautman says which she describes as an appeal to the older generation and russian leaders have successfully rewritten parts of that history she says for example putinsigned a ban on comparisons between the soviet union and nazi germany last july that means someone could be jailed for mentioning

political and civil leaders to get them out of power and then try them in some way thats where the language of genocide comes in he added i think its very likely and hes said as much that he intends to use the genocide and denazification language to set up some kind of kangaroo court which would serve the purpose of condemning these people to death or   prison or incarceration casanova and lautman praise the strength and determination of ukrainians noting they are putting up a resistance if russia does succeed lautman says she is confident it would round up and execute political leaders and journalists there europethe icc says it will open an investigation into alleged war crimes in ukraine the experts point to the importance of learning from history and the present moment something that the u s and other countries have not always done casanova says the current moment proves that the world must create an equitable security system that is not manipulated by the superpowers and

putin ordered a fullscale invasion in february all six reactors have since been shut down the plant has had several close calls including from repeated artillery strikes that cut the electric lines maintaining its cooling operations it is now faced with a dwindling supply of water because of the dam breach after the construction of the plant in the s the reservoir of the kakhovka dam was used to fill the holding pond cooling its reactors and spent fuel as of june the pond’s water level stands at aboutmetersfeet — only four meters above the minimum level necessary to cool the plant said Olena Pareniuk a senior researcher at ukraine’s national academy of sciences who has studied nuclear power plant disasters the situation led the international atomic energy agency’s general director to conduct an emergency inspection of the nuclear plant days after the dam breach in a statement posted on the iaea’s website rafael mariano grossi said thecooling pond is being replenished with water from a discharge channel at a nearby coalfired power plant and from a drainage system fed by underground water at the current rate of evaporation — about four inches a day grossi estimated that the plant has enough water for “many weeks ” he also said he saw no evidence it had been mined photos deal evolving to protect ukrainian nuclear plant at risk of catastrophe just as concerning however is the added pressure on remaining ukrainian staff Pareniuk said perhaps only of its employees are left to oversee its operations — “barely enough” to keep the plant safe in a shutdown state and far too few for an emergency “the threat of a terrorist attack is high ” said a ukrainian employee still working at the plant whom the washington post is not naming to protect his safety he said the plant has already reduced the amount of water used to cool the reactors — the hottest of which according to pareniuk is still at aboutdegrees fahrenheit even after being shut down advertisement ukrainian officials and atomic energy experts warn that without sufficient cooling a reactor’s core could overheat allowing the buildup of an explosive mixture of hydrogen gas and steam that could rupture the containment structure and blow dangerous amounts of radiation into the air the reactors could melt down anywhere fromhours to two weeks without water budanov said what could happen then pareniuk and other experts said it is unlikely to be anything like chernobyl which blew when the reactor was in active operation she said the most likely worstcase scenario could be something on scale with thefukushima disaster in when fuel in three of the japanese nuclear plant’s four reactors melted down following a massive earthquake and tsunami if so a poisonous cloud could spread across ukraine contaminating its agricultural heartland and probably drifting over european neighbors with radioactive particles that increase the risk of certain cancers radioactive contamination is likely to reach the dnieper river too flowing into the black sea depending on water currents the contamination could touch every country along the black sea’s shores Pareniuk said as a bioradiologist she understands
